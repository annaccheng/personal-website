            <p>I’m a Product Manager that loves human-centered design and dabbles in a bit of coding and ML as well. I’m a rising senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Business. I’m passionate about building scalable products, advancing how we build with AI, and solving difficult problems. I also love puzzles in general (mega NYT mini, crossword, and sudoku fiend), art, film photography, and hiking!</p>
